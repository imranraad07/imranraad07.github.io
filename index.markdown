- Prospective students

Not Hiring PhD or Master's students right now.

If you're interested in joining my research team, please contact me at imranm@mst.edu. In your email, include a brief introduction, interests and attach your CV (if you can). I am currently recruiting students at all levels, from undergraduate and masters (if you are already in Missouri S&T), to graduate. If you don't hear back from me within a week, feel free to send a follow-up message as things can get busy. 

If you are already a student at Missouri S&T, please feel free to email me to talk about potential research opportunities.

When you are emailing, here is a guideline you can follow: [Link](https://uvasrg.github.io/prospective/)
